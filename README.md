# Problem Statement

For this project, i have scrapped about 8 months long of index options data from HKEX website, all of which are active outstanding call & puts options contracts currently being traded, with different strike price, call/put premium, high/low, close, IV%, and volumn. Basic EDA was performed on top of our data to get a general sense of data distribution and spot anamolies. The concept of volatility smile was tested on our data.
